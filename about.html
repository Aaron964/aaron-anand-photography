    <p>I am a passionate and dedicated photographer who loves to capture life's special moments and turn them into timeless memories.
     With an eye for detail and a creative flair, I strive to produce images that not only document the subject, 
     but also evoke emotion and tell a story. 
     My ultimate goal is to create images that my clients will cherish for years to come, 
     and to make their experience working with me as enjoyable and stress-free as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    I believe that great photography is about capturing emotions, moments, and memories. 
    That's why I approach each project with a personal touch, 
    working closely with my clients to understand their vision and create images that truly reflect who they are. 
    Since I am still an amateur, my areas of expertise are not too diverse but I'm gradually learning. 
    Here are the types of photography that I truly excel in:

    I got into photography at a very young age and was fascinated when I first saw a camera. 
    I couldn't beleive that something could capture a precious moment to cherish it on later. 
    After researching a lot about photography, I stumbled across <strong>Edward Weston</strong> 
    who is widely recognised as the <em>'Master of 20th Century Photography'</em>. 
    His photographs really inspired me and made me acknowledge the small things in life. 
    </p>
    <p>
    There have been a lot of documentaries on Edward Weston and as I learn more about him, I begin to understand that he was more 
    of a philosopher than a photographer. Here is an audio clip from one of his documentaries:

    While photography has always been my passsion, I wanted to enter into the field of computer science.
    After finishing my high school in my home country India, I am currently studying 
    <i>Bachelor of Computer Science at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.</i> 
    Since I have my classes pretty much every weekday, I would be able to commit to an extensive & elaborate photoshoot only on weekends. 
    Take a look at my schedule if you want to book an appointment for a photoshoot.
